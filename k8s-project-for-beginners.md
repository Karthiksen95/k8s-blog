Hello and welcome to my blog! In this post, I will show you how to start your own Kubernetes project for beginners. Kubernetes is an amazing technology that allows you to automate the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of your containerized applications. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. If you are new to Kubernetes, you might be wondering what it is and why you should use it. Let me explain.

Kubernetes is a platform that orchestrates your containers across multiple nodes or machines. It ensures that your application runs reliably and efficiently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. You can use Kubernetes to deploy your application to any cloud provider, such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or even your own data center. Kubernetes also provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, health checks, rolling updates, and more.

To get started with Kubernetes, you will need some prerequisites:

- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with the Linux Terminal
- Familiarity with Docker (suggested read: The Docker Handbook)

You will also need to install some tools:

- kubectl: The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters
- minikube: A tool that lets you run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your local machine
- helm: A package manager for Kubernetes that helps you install and manage applications

You can find the installation instructions for these tools on their respective websites.

Once you have installed these tools, you can create your first Kubernetes cluster using minikube. To do this, open a terminal and run the following command:
bash
minikube start
```

This will start a virtual machine on your local machine and install Kubernetes on it. You can check the status of your cluster by running:

```bash
minikube status
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

This means that your cluster is ready to use. You can also access the Kubernetes dashboard by running:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

This will open a web browser and show you a graphical interface for managing your cluster.

Now that you have a cluster, you can deploy your first application to it. For this tutorial, we will use a simple Node.js application that suggests to people what they should eat depending on the time of day. You can find the source code for this application in this GitHub repository:

https://github.com/fhsinchy/kubernetes-handbook-projects

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the hello-kube directory. This directory contains two files:

- app.js: The main file that contains the application logic
- Dockerfile: The file that defines how to build a Docker image for the application

To build a Docker image for the application, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t hello-kube .
```

This will create an image named hello-kube and tag it with the latest version. You can verify that the image was created by running:

```bash
docker images hello-kube
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
hello-kube latest 7f8c0a1a9a2c 15 seconds ago 122MB
```

Now that you have an image, you can push it to a registry where Kubernetes can pull it from. For this tutorial, we will use Docker Hub as our registry. If you don't have an account on Docker Hub, you can create one for free here:

https://hub.docker.com/

Once you have an account, you need to log in to Docker Hub from your terminal by running:

```bash
docker login
```

Enter your username and password when prompted. Then, you need to tag your image with your username and push it to Docker Hub by running:

```bash
docker tag hello-kube <your-username>/hello-kube
docker push <your-username>/hello-kube
```

Replace <your-username> with your actual username on Docker Hub. This will upload your image to Docker Hub under your username.

Now that you have pushed your image to Docker Hub, you can deploy it to Kubernetes using kubectl. To do this, you need to create a YAML file that defines how Kubernetes should run your application. In the hello-kube directory, create a file named deployment.yaml
